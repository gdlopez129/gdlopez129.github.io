				<p><b>NOTICE!: <i>Hello dear Traveler! Since you're probably new to Genshin Impact, Teyvat Map for Dummies would like to present you with a very special gift: the location of 3 Luxurious chests.

				Chests, even Common ones, are very valuable as you rank up in the game, so knowing the locations of some chests with the highest value will surely be of some help to you!

						<p> The second chest is located inside a ship. It's easy to spot, but in order to get there, you can either glide from a nearby teleportation waypoint, or you can use a Cryo character to make a bridge (Teyvat Map for Dummies would like to suggest that you use Kaeya if your stamina's low).</p>					</div>

						<p> The third chest is hidden and can only be unlocked in co-op mode. Once you and another player reach this island, you'll find a heart-shaped rock waiting for you. Once both players should step inside said rock, and a chest will spawn right away.</p>

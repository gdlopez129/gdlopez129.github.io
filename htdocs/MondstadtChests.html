				<p><b>NOTICE!: <i>Hello dear Traveler! Since you're probably new to Genshin Impact, Teyvat Map for Dummies would like to present you with a very special gift: the location of 3 Luxurious chests.

				Chests, even Common ones, are very valuable as you rank up in the game, so knowing the locations of some chests with the highest value will surely be of some help to you!
